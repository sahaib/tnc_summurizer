# TnC Summarizer

A Python GUI application that summarizes Terms and Conditions (TnC) documents in real-time using AI.

## Features:
- Summarizes TnC from pasted text or URLs
- Built with Cursor IDE
- Utilizes OpenAI's API for summarization
- Provides up-to-date summaries, unlike static TnC summary websites

## Usage:
1. Replace the placeholder with your OpenAI API key in the code
2. Run the application
3. Paste TnC text or URL to get an instant summary

## Note:
While similar functionality exists in ChatGPT and Claude, this project serves as a fun use case and learning experience.
